- It's very easy. Just create a file named `404.md` or `404.html` on the root directory of your homepage.
- Surely, we need to make it more interesting:

~~~md

title: 404
layout: page
---

<script language="JavaScript"> function myrefresh(){window.location="/";}setTimeout('myrefresh()',5000);</script>

## Error 404. Nothing was found :(   

How did you get to this link?

Please go to [homepage](/) or email me:

    zhaozxcpu@hotmail.com

## The page will redirect to the homepage after 5 seconds.....

~~~

- Here, I use my template "page" layout for it, similar to my homepage. 
- The javascript will refresh the 404 page after 5 second and redirect it to my homepage.
- Below it something you want to say~

Hey, see the result here: [My 404](http://platinhom.github.io/404)

Ref2 Yi Zeng also told you a method to create a 404.html page and use redirection in head of html. You can read it. But I recommand my method, it's easy and could retain you homepage style easily :)

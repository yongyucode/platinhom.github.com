## Alexey Onufriev (virginia tech)

condenseation of RNA/DNA by multi-valent counter-ions (由于反离子的中和,可以帮助DNA压缩)

monovalent ions: too little attraction, for same entropy need more ions  
trivalent ions can condese short dsDNA in solution, but can't work for dsRNA.

*NAR, 2014 10823-10831* (MD, 500ns) ion bind to the groove of RNA but only around DNA to create a atmosphrer

elestristatic potential revel that RNA narrow groove have stronger negative charge inside. Furthermore, DNA have aternating charge pattern at outside, but RNA has nearly uniformly charged duplex(ion binding to groove and eliminate the alternating charge), no chance to lower energy further by bringing them closer.

When MD, Na+ distribution is sensitive to water model; but multi-valent ion is insensitive to water model.

condensation propensity of double stranded nucleic acid depends on the distribution of multivalent

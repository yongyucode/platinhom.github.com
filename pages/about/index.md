>Love science, love your own life. Just do what you like!

I'm doing research in computational chemistry/biology. My reseach interest includes computer-aider drug design, chemoinformatic, computational biology. I also love the study for organic mass spectromety I did before.  

Computation related sciences need to remember lots of informations. Here I just put some notes on my blog here. Hope it help!

>Love science, love your own life.

I got my B.S. from China Pharmaceutical University in Pharmacy and Ph.D. from Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, CAS.  
I did the organic mass spectrometric research before my change to computational study. Now I'm doing my postdoc research at maths dept. in MSU.  
Computation related sciences need to remember lots of informations. Here I just put some notes on my blog here. Hope it help!

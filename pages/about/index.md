> Act as you like.

I'm doing research in computational chemistry/biology. My reseach interest includes computer-aider drug design, chemoinformatic, computational biology. I also love the research for organic mass spectromety  and organic chemistry I did before. I wanna combine my knowledge on computational chemistry/biology and organic chemistry to solve problems in sciences, especially in drug design. 

Computation related sciences need to remember lots of information. Here I just put some notes on my blog here. Hope it help!

> Act as your thought.

I'm doing research in computational chemistry/biology. My reseach interest includes computer-aider drug design, chemoinformatic, computational biology. I also love the research for organic mass spectromety  and organic chemistry I did before. I wanna combine my knowledge on computational chemistry/biology and organic chemistry to solve problems in sciences, especially in drug design. 

Computation related sciences need to remember lots of information. Here I just put some notes on my blog here. Hope it help!

Welcome to give your valuable comments or mail to me: zhaozxcpu(a-t)hotmail.com !    

## Some Tools I developed:
- [MIBPB webserver](http://23.239.23.221/MIBPBweb/): automatic online server based on matched interface PB solver to calculate electrostatic solvation energy, ESES/MSMS surface, structure preparation, 
- AutoT&T2 and PG-AutoT&T: Fragment-based lead optimization tool. AutoT&T speeding up and new pharmacophore guided optimization/de novo design.
- AutoPhD (Pharmacophore percerption): Pharmacophore perception for ligand/protein or protein/protein complex.

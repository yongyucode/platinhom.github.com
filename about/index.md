>Love science, love your own life.

I got my B.S. from China Pharmaceutical University in Pharmacy and Ph.D. from Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, CAS. </br>
I did the organic mass spectrometric research before my change to computational study. Now I'm doing my postdoc research at maths dept. in MSU.</br>
Computation related sciences need to remember lots of informations. Here I just put some notes on my blog here. Hope it help!</br>
